## Abstract

Compared to the plethora of software tools that support _designing_ hardware, there are relatively few tools that support _troubleshooting_ and _maintaining_ hardware. As a result, providing technical support for hardware is often ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by software troubleshooting workflows like StackOverflow, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow. SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object that scaffolds asynchronous communication about hardware between multiple users. A SplatOverflow scene comprises a <sidenote><text>3D Gaussian Splat</text><note>[3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023]](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) is a view-interpolation and rasterization technique that renders a 3D scene as a collection of Gaussian distributions.</note></sidenote> of the end-user's hardware registered onto the hardware's CAD model. These two elements enable multiple users to remotely and independently inspect a hardware instance, easily compare the hardware instance to it's design or associated documentation, and communicate actions or instructions the end-user must carry out. SplatOverflow links these comments, instructions and discussions to the CAD parts they reference and stores them for future users to easily query and access. Similar to StackOverflow, this allows communities of users to build pools of shared technical knowledge about the hardware they are all using. In the paper accompanying this project, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, detail the workflows it enables, and explain its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a user study.

<!-- As tools for designing and manufacturing hardware become more accessible, smaller producers can develop and distribute novel hardware. However, there aren't established tools to support end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance. As a result, technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by software troubleshooting workflows like StackOverflow, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow. SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware.

With SplatOverflow, maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user's workspace. The instructions define workflows that can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments. In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, detail the workflows it enables, and illustrate its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a user study. -->

## Demonstrative Examples

We demonstrate SplatOverflow with a variety of hardware examples, including a pick-and-place machine (the [LumenPnP v3, by Opulo](https://docs.opulo.io/semi-assembly/)), a 3D printer (the [Prusa MK3S+](https://help.prusa3d.com/manual/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit-assembly_1128)), and an open-source e-reader ([The Open Book, by Oddly Specific Objects](https://www.oddlyspecificobjects.com/projects/openbook/)).
